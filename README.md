Drops a Powershell Dropper script That downloads 3 Archives that are Extracted and ran.

Then all 3 of them are added to scheduled tasks

Also tries to Disable UAC, but the victim will quickly notice something is wrong with their PC. 

After building the source You get a Windows Notification Related to User Account Control.

This is a very basic RAT that Executes commands given from the host (20.117.108.240) and uses 3 Different Telegram bots for notifications

However, i managed to send a message to only one of the bots. No reply from the owner.

The entire Sourcecode is provided in this repo as well as The original files

Some of the Variable names are encrypted, I decided to pull the ones that are related to the server.
